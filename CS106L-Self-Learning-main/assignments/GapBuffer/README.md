# GapBuffer
In this programming assignment, you will implement a sequential container class, which is optimized for fast inserttion and deletion operations at any position. For detailed description of HashMap and guidance on this assignment, you can refer to this [document](./doc/Short%20Assignment%203%20-%20Gap%20Buffer.pdf). To build and test your codes, you can refer to the following commands. You can selectively enable testcases corresponding to the functionalities you have already implemented by changing macro definitions in the header of [gap_buffer_test.cc](./gap_buffer_test.cc).

```shell
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./gap_buffer_test
```
